/**
 *  `Endpoint` describes a network endpoint of a service that serves a set of
 *  APIs. It is commonly known as a service endpoint. A service may expose
 *  any number of service endpoints, and all service endpoints share the same
 *  service definition, such as quota limits and monitoring metrics.
 * 
 *  Example service configuration:
 * 
 *      name: library-example.googleapis.com
 *      endpoints:
 *        # Below entry makes 'google.example.library.v1.Library'
 *        # API be served from endpoint address library-example.googleapis.com.
 *        # It also allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be passed to the backend, for
 *        # it to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is
 *        # allowed to proceed.
 *      - name: library-example.googleapis.com
 *        allow_cors: true
